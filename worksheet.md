Captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is designed to distinguish between human users and automated bots. While captchas are effective in preventing many automated attacks, no system is entirely foolproof, and there have been instances where captchas have been hacked or beaten.

Some common methods used to bypass captchas include:

OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Automated bots can use OCR technology to recognize and interpret the characters in a captcha image.

Machine Learning: Sophisticated machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize and solve captchas by analyzing patterns and structures in the images.

Crowdsourcing: Attackers may employ human workers through crowdsourcing platforms to solve captchas manually.

Pre-processing Attacks: Attackers may attempt to manipulate the captcha images before processing them, making it easier for automated tools to recognize and solve them.

Developers continually work to improve captcha systems and implement new techniques to stay ahead of attackers. This includes adopting more advanced visual distortions, utilizing audio challenges, and incorporating additional layers of complexity. Despite these efforts, it remains an ongoing challenge to create captchas that are both user-friendly and highly resistant to automated attacks.
