It begins with a corporate merger on November the fifteenth of 2015. 
The Marriott Corporation merged with Starwood, 
another hotel chain. 
The transaction closed on September 23rd, 2016. 
It was in that ten month window that the Marriott looked at all Starwood's technology and network in an attempt to assess an integration plan. 
The evaluation was limited by the fact that until the merger formally closed,
Starwood was still a competitor. 
The decision was made to maintain the Marriott's system as the primary system for reservations. 
It took another two years to migrate all of Starwood's 1,270 hotels onto the Marriott reservation system. 
This all had to be done without disrupting the existing reservation process at the Marriott. 
After the close of the merger, 
the Marriott continued to operate the Starwood reservation system. 
Additional security investments were made in the system which was evaluated as coming up short when compared to the existing security on the Marriott reservation system.
In September of the 2018,
a company which managed the Starwood guest reservation database contacted the Marriott IT team with information about an alert generated. 
An IBM security product used on the Starwood system that helped secure the databases was triggered by a query from an administrator's account to return the count of rows from a table in a database,
and the query would not return the content of the rows,
rather,
only the total number of rows in the table. 
This set off red flags and commenced an investigation by the Marriott IT team. 
It was discovered that the individual whose credentials were used had not actually made the query. 
Containment protocols were invoked. 
The Marriott engaged legal counsel and industry experts to investigate the scale and scope of the incident. 
They subsequently brought in third party investigators for a full forensic investigation in an effort to understand what led to the alert and to assist with the containment. 
The outside investigators found the RAT. 
Once it was determined that a RAT was involved a fuller investigation was undertaken to mitigate risk. 
The Marriott had to know what had been accessed and what had been stolen from their database. 
By the end of October,
2018,
the FBI was contacted. 
In November of that same year the investigation discovered two compressed, 
encrypted files had been deleted from a device that was being examined. 
Given that the files have been encrypted,
the actual content was not known. 
There was also evidence that two files had been removed from the Starwood network. 
It was decrypted in November of 2018. 
One contained an export of a table from the Starwood guest reservation database with guest data, 
and the other contained an export of a table holding passport information. 
It was at this point that the Marriott realized it had to make the information public. 
It was the realization that guest information in the form of passports have been accessed. 
They had a legal obligation.
