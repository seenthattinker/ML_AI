# The Terrible World of Vishing 


Vishing is a new threat in the world of cybersecurity.  
You've probably heard of phishing before.  
It's when you get an email asking for personal information,
or compelling you to respond to some form of emergency.  
These phishing emails are used all the time to gain access to sensitive networks.  
Vishing is the digital equivalent of this.
The term is a concatenation of the words _voice_ and _phishing_,
and it substitutes voice calls for emails,
but they're essentially the same thing
&mdash;
pressure tactics to get you to reposnd to a situation that you assume,
if you fall for the scam,
requires imemdiate attention. 





The advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in the last several years have not only contributed to more productivity in the workforce but also to a higher level of digital crime. 
It's now possible for  AI to mimic the voice of somebody you know.  
Imagine this terrifying scenario. 
You're at home in the United States and you get a call from your daughter or son in their early twenties. 
The last you heard or knew they were enjoying a vacation in Cancun,
Mexico. 
Now they're on the phone
&mdash;
frightened and frazzled. 
Something has gone wrong in the vacation and they need twelve thousand dollars and change to be bailed out. 
It could be a medical bill. 
It could be a damage to a car they rented and failed to _fully_ insure.
There's no end to the kind of scam that coulbe used.
The problem is,
from your end, 
it really is the voice of your son or daughter. 
It really is an emergency that threatens your adult child. 
You would have absolutely no reason to doubt it. 

Then the phone is passed to an individual who speaks good English but with a heavy Latin accent. He might be the desk sergeant at the particular police precinct in Cancun. He walks you through all the ways you can pay the fine from the United States. You are assured that when the fine is paid your son or daughter will be released and there will be no further action against them.

Vishing, short for "voice phishing," is a form of social engineering in which an attacker uses phone calls to trick individuals into revealing sensitive personal or financial information. It is a type of phishing scam that relies on verbal communication rather than email or other digital communication methods. Vishing attacks typically involve the following:

Impersonation: The attacker may pose as a trusted entity, such as a bank representative, government official, tech support agent, or a reputable organization, to gain the victim's trust.

Manipulative tactics: Vishing attackers often use various manipulation techniques to create a sense of urgency or fear, pressuring the victim to divulge information. They may claim there's a security issue, an outstanding debt, or some other reason that requires immediate action.

Solicitation of information: The attacker may request sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card details, bank account information, or login credentials, under the pretense of resolving an issue or offering assistance.

Call spoofing: Some vishing attacks involve caller ID spoofing, making it appear as though the call is coming from a legitimate source, further convincing the victim of the call's authenticity.

Vishing attacks can be highly effective because they rely on human psychology and often exploit individuals' trust in phone-based communication. To protect against vishing:

Verify the caller's identity: If you receive an unexpected call from an institution or organization, don't provide sensitive information immediately. Hang up and independently verify the caller's identity by calling a known, legitimate phone number.

Be skeptical: Be cautious if the caller pressures you to provide personal or financial information urgently. Legitimate organizations will usually allow you time to verify their identity.

Use call-blocking tools: Consider using call-blocking or caller ID verification tools to reduce the likelihood of receiving calls from spoofed numbers.

Educate yourself and others: Be aware of the signs of vishing and educate your family and colleagues about these scams to reduce the risk of falling victim to them.
