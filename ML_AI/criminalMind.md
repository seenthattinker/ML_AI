# The Psychology of Cybercrime


When people think of online attacks and identity theft and the various scams that go along with it, they usually think in terms of Technology, but just like all crime the main culprit is psychology. In the digital landscape the psychology comes into the selection of the mark. In the colloquial of the criminal a mark is the person who has been marked to be robbed. Street criminals know how to look for the right people to Rob. It's a combination of things: The Way You Walk, your confidence level, the criminals belief that you could fight back, and too many more to list here. In the online world the digital criminal has no visual reference for the mark, but they do have characteristics, and these characteristics are defined by where you shop. This has become such a prevalent Trend in cyber crime that security companies have  begun keeping lists of the most impersonated companies.


Why is this important? Because cyber crime can only take place against people who make transactions online, and those transactions can only take place with companies who sell online. That's the basic outline of the situation. It's after this that the psychology comes into play.
