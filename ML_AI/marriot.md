# The Marriott Hotel and the RAT


Can you inherit data breaches in IT security? 
The answer is a resounding yes. 
It happened to the Marriott hotel chains in 2018,
and has become part of the lore of the digital security world,
one of the most infamous data breaches in it history,
and standing in most top lists for computer and network security breaches.

The reason for the RATs is the same as any data breach, 
theft, 
access to classified or restricted material, 
personal data records, 
financial data and credit card numbers, 
and just about anything else that cyber criminals are after in a breach of a network or a computer.
It turns out that a digital RAT is a bad for reputation as literal rats in the hotel business. 




A RAT is a a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is malware that can gain remote control over a computer or network.
It takes its name from the classical story from antiquity,
the Trojan Horse.
The reason for this is RATs are disguised as something that might belong on your system,
a file or application. 
This is part of the deception.
The attackers are hoping you click on it.

A RAT gets into its target system by stealth.
It disguises itself as a software update or an attachment on an email or something else innocuous and not suspicious or raising alarms.  
Once inside it stays hidden,
just like real rats,
sensitive to everything around them,
motion,
smell,
vibration,
and only breaking cover when everything is quiet and calm. 
RATs are designed to survive the sweeeps of antivirus software and other security measures.
They come in different sizes,
just like real rats,
but in the digital analogy size is potency
&mdash;
the level and degree of remote access and control. 
A really well formed RAT can gain access to your computer, 
your microphone, 
and all of your files and programs.
It can basically do whatever the user of the computer can do and see whatever the user of the computer can see.







It highlights why you must do a security audit of everything that you bring into your network. It cannot be assumed that everything is good with new additions to your network. The Marriott Hotel chain had to learn this the hard way.  When you think about all of the money that companies spend to promote and brand themselves in the public mind, a data breach of this magnitude that goes public is the equivalent of  counter spending from a marketing perspective.  Why not just spend the money on security at the outset? Think of it as part of your marketing budget, or, at the very least, an ancillary fund in the security department that compliments your marketing budget,  because if things go bad in your it security and the public becomes aware of it your Market reputation is in tatters.
