# Phising: No License Required 

In the world of cyber crime Phising remains one of the most consistent and successful tools for gaining access to a computer or network.
Its range of use is vast.
It's employed by the most sophisticated and organized of cyber crime groups
&mdash;
including state-sponsored cyber crime groups
&mdash;
right down to the most unsophisticated and disconnected of hackers,
the loners living in their parents' basements.
Phisinhg as been a key step in some of the biggest heists in cyber crime history,
most notably the theft of $81 million US dollars from the Central Bank of Bangladesh.
It's a standard tool for gaining access to credit and debit card information anas well as a plethora of personal information that can easily be sold in the black markets on the dark web.

## What is Phising


Phising,
in its simplest definition,
is the use of an email to entice or convince the recipient to click on an attachment or follow a set of instructions on a web page accessed through a click-through URL.
In either case,
the attachment or the web page,
the recipient is susceptible to intrusion into their computer or network system,
whether that system be your home computer,
which might contain more passwords and more access for the hackers,
or your work network,
which opens your professional network to the hackers.
Phising is one of the oldest and consistently successful tools used by hackers.


A basic and common example of phising is the phony email from PayPal&trade;.
Your payment information is not up to date.
Would you _please_ go to the following URL and update your payment information to continue using PayPal,
or it couild be a threat alert.
Your PayPal account might be compromised.
There was a suspicious login from Indonesia.
Was this you?
This emotional imperative is used often.
They want to scare you into thinking you have already been hacked,
and you could lose money.
Of course,
the website you are directed to is not the official PayPal website,
and you were duped into giving the information to log onto your PayPal account to the fraudsters.
It can happen fast
&mdash;
boom, boom, boom
&mdash;
like firecrackers going off.
How hard would it have been to thwart?
Contact PayPal,
or go to their real website and login to verify that your payment details are incorrect.
In fairness to the victims,
the emails can be quite official looking
&mdash;
correct logo,
correct personal information for you,
and other indicators that you can trust the nmessage and,
therefore,
the attachment or URL.


## The Variety of Phising 


There are phising scams for all kinds of different demographics,
the old,
the Young,
pensioners,
and successful businesses.
Data aggregated year in and year out suggests that nobody is immune and phising scams are growing every year.
Cybercrime is so widespread that even the Department of Homeland Security is involved in the United States.
It's not the same old stunt over and over again.
Phising is in a constant state of evolution,
adaptation,
and growth in sophistry.
The more diligent practitioners of phising take their time to case a subject who they want to target.
This could include numerous hours monitoring and surveilling their social media platforms for deeper insight into the target.
This insight can then be used to _personalize_ the email in some way,
to intimate familiarity,
which takes down the defenses of the target,
makes them feel secure in clicking on the link or attachment.
They are criminals,
but they do due diligence.

Cyber security experts now train and advise people on what they post on social media.
The use of social media was an integral part of the attack on the Central Bank of Bangladesh.
Your social media profiles
&mdash;
Facebook,
LinkedIn,
Twitter (X),
and Instagram
&mdash;
allow  cyber criminals to understand you and present themselves as familiars.
The numver one rule:
do not post any work-related data on your social media platforms.

## Criminal Evolution 




As technology evolves,
so does cyber crime.
The advertising industry is beginning to significantly define time and geography delimited digital advertising on mobile devices.
This is done through collecting device IDs and the geographic location of the user,
all of which are commercial data products colleced and sold now in the legitinate business world.
For example,
you're walking towards a subway platform after work.

It's a late Wednesday afternoon,
maybe 5:15 PM,
and you get an advertisement on your phone for a coffee from your favorite coffee shop,
which,
non-coincidentally,
you just happen to be walking past on your way to the subway stop,
and the advertisement is for a coffee you love,
which they know because you've bought it numerous times in the past using your
&mdash;
_yeh, you got it_
&mdash;
your telephone as the elctronic payment instrument,
and all this manufactured synergy was gathered and strategically deployeyd to produce an effective advertisement on your phone,
effective because you bought the coffee. 
Now,
imagine this same cutting edge advertising technique employed in phising.
You see where this is going?


## Commercial Phishing

If the loan operator in his mom's basement,
or the small groups of competent cyber criminals were not enough, 
we now have the age of commercial phising,
an almost one-to-one match for the actual trade of ocean fishing. 
The loan operator would be like the old Cuban man in Ernest Hemingway's _Old Man and the Sea_, 
and the commercial phising operations are like Chinese or Portuguese deep sea fishing boats with huge nets.
There are vendors now selling services for Phising as a Service (PaaS).


In the second quarter of 2023 cyber security experts became aware of a product called _Greatness_.
Cisco&trade; reported the following in a security blog it posted on May 10 of 2023.



"A previously unreported phishing-as-a-service (PaaS) offering named _Greatness_ has been used in several phishing campaigns since at least mid-2022. Greatness incorporates features seen in some of the most advanced PaaS offerings, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) bypass, IP filtering and integration with Telegram bots.
Greatness, for now, is only focused on Microsoft 365 phishing pages, providing its affiliates with an attachment and link builder that creates highly convincing decoy and login pages. It contains features such as having the victim’s email address pre-filled and displaying their appropriate company logo and background image, extracted from the target organization’s real Microsoft 365 login page. This makes Greatness particularly well-suited for phishing business users."


This, 
to be sure, 
is the first of many offerings to be made in the area of commercial fishing.  
It will be nearly impossible to stop the sale of this type of software on the dark web. 
It's been nearly impossible to stop the sale of almost everything else on the dark web. 


## Proceed with Caution 


Your defense is your responsibility, 
whether you be an individual computer user or an employee at a larger corporate entity. 
The main defense is training. 
Most organizations now will have a security department that regularly monitors and stays abreast of what the latest online scams are, 
and, 
as part of their function within the larger organization, 
they train the rest of the employees. 
This training should be current and up to date. 
New phising attack methods are being developed all the time. 
Make sure that all of your employees understand the basics of the World Wide Web. 
Train them to never give their information to an unsecured site. 
The URL must begin with https, 
and you should be able to see a closed padlock icon next to the URL. 
This may seem a bit excessive because not every site without a security certificate is a scam, 
but better safe than sorry, 
especially when you're operating from a work computer and allowing risk to the entire network. 
It's very important that your organization set up a password rotation schedule and remind employees with emails.
Regular online traing courses should be taken online by employees,
and either developed in-house by the documentation and training team,
or out-sourced to reputable vendors with a solid track record.
Nothing is going to secure your network better than a trained and eductated workforce.
This has been standard practice in the financial sector for well over two decades,
but it needs to be adopted in all industries.



The other thing you can do to protect yourself is invest in technology and tools,
especially if you interact with the public online,
and this could be as innocuous as taking in information.
Always make sure they're human.
Bot access to your system is another type of phising but backwards.
Rather than you going to the scam through an attachment or a URL,
the scam comes to you in the form of a bot,
but once that bot gains access to your system it can do the samer damage as the phish.
It's a known fact in the cyber security world that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a critical component in hindering phising and other types of online crime,
but not all MFA products are equal.
Just as you now know platforms like Greatness can bypass weak MFA tools,
you should also know that not all MFA tools are the same.
Some are hollow and one-dimensional.
Others,
like hCaptcha&trade;,
are cutting edge in the use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). 
You have to protect yourself intelligently,
and what better way than AI and ML?
